=head1 NAME

Video::DVDRip - GUI for copying DVDs, based on an open Low Level API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl module consists currently of two major components:

  1. A low level OO style API for ripping and transcoding
     DVD video, which is based on Thomas Oestreichs program
     transcode, a Linux Video Stream Processing Tool.
     This API is currently well undocumented.

  2. A Gtk+ based Perl program called 'dvd::rip' which provides
     a nice GUI to control all necessary steps from ripping,
     adjusting all parameters and transcoding the video to
     the format you desire.

The distribution name is derived from the Perl namespace it occupies:
Video::DVDRip. Although the DVD Ripper GUI is called dvd::rip, because
it's shorter and easier to pronounce (if you omit the colons... ;)

You'll find all information regarding installation and usage of
dvd::rip in the README file shipped with the distribution or
on the dvd::rip homepage:
